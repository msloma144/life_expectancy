# Analysis of Life Expectancy Based on Localization in Lucas County

## Introduction

This project analyzed the effects of economic data (such as income and distance from downtown Toledo) on life 
expectancy per census tract in Lucas County. The data for this project was collected from the U.S. Small-area Life 
Expectancy Estimates Project (USALEEP) and the US Census Bureau. 

The method of analysis was multivariate ordinary least squares regression. After running a regression, it was shown 
that the income was the most economically significant outcome, as an additional $10,000 in income will lead to about 
an extra half a year (.48 years) of life expectancy on average, all else held constant.
